In order for your agency to align your LACS infrastructure with the FICAM architecture, existing policies, processes, and technologies may need to be changed. You should evaluate your agencyâ€™s logical access policies and identify potential gaps where revisions, updates, and new policies and/or standards are needed to drive the changes identified in the FICAM architecture gap analysis for logical access. Your agency may need to consider establishing working groups and/or cross functional teams within the overall ICAM  governance structure to directly support LACS projects. This approach ensures that a responsible party is established to assess, manage, and maintain LACS policies and procedures over time.

While each agency is unique in the maturity of its logical access policies, there are a number of common topics that should be incorporated to support the LACS effort. The checklist below includes a list of the common governance efforts and describes how agencies might consider using them as a means to support compliance and overcome implementation hurdles.

## <span style="color: #0C5C89">**Checklist**</span>

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Issue Policy Memorandum: Continued Implementation of HSPD-12.** Agency-level policy, as required by <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2011/m11-11.pdf" target="_blank">  M-11-11 </a>, that includes provisions for several items related to LACS, including enforcing the use of PIV cards for authentication to networks and applications and accepting PIV credentials issued by other federal agencies for logical access. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Identify common logical access scenarios.** Establish guidance reflecting agency-level decisions for handling common logical access problem scenarios, such as granting access when a user forgets/loses his or her PIV card or forgets the personal identification number (PIN), requires mobile/remote access and does not have access to a smart card reader, and hardware malfunction preventing use of the PIV card.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Define agency-level security benchmarks.** Implement additional security benchmarks, beyond federal standards and guidance, for internally owned and operated IT resources to require use of LACS services and authentication tools.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Define roles and responsibilities for cross-functional working groups.** Establish roles and responsibilities for cross functional working groups to facilitate collaboration and achievement of stated objectives between members from multiple groups, offices, and bureaus/components within the agency.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Define enterprise data and attribute format standards.** Define standard data formats for identity and entitlement attributes to streamline provisioning and application integration processes. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Determine trusted authoritative sources.** Define authoritative sources for identity and entitlement attributes to ensure access to accurate, reliable information. Authoritative sources may include HR, Personnel Security, Payroll, or other systems.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Determine core user identity attributes.** Define a core set of attributes that are required to uniquely identify an individual at an enterprise level to ensure consistency between the authoritative sources, LACS infrastructure, and IT resources.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Define baseline user privileges for IT Access.** Can be accomplished at various levels within your agency and should be considered where significant efficiencies can be achieved. When linked to an automated provisioning capability, new users can be granted access to a large number of applications automatically, based on a well-defined set of baseline needs.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Define a stakeholder messaging strategy.** Allows your agency to identify stakeholders and understand their individual motivations, and business drivers. Knowing these characteristics allows you to tailor multiple custom messages, which will improve adoption and overall buy-in. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Determine staffing strategy.** Develop a plan/strategy to rotate/reallocate staff members whose positions may be automated (i.e., electronic account creation) as part of the LACS effort.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Define agency-level privacy requirements.** Determine if existing privacy and data protection requirements/guidelines are sufficient to address privacy concerns associated with LACS automation and data sharing or if additional privacy requirements are needed for specific LACS services.
