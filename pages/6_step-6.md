After an agency has successfully deployed its LACS solution to a live production level, the project enters the Operate and Maintain Phase. This phase lasts for the remainder of the time that the LACS solution is in use and consists of ongoing management and system maintenance activities such as: conducting training, operating the LACS solution, and protecting new resources as they are integrated with the enterprise solution.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Monitor Security Controls.** Conduct Step 6 of the Risk Management Framework (RMF): Monitor Security Controls by monitoring changes to the information system and its environment of operation and conducting ongoing assessments of security controls in accordance with the monitoring strategy.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Ongoing User Training.** Continue to update and modify user training curriculums as the LACS solution matures, new resources are protected, and new users are added. Conduct additional training as necessary.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Execute Change Control Board (CCB).** Conduct activities with the CCB to evaluate potential changes to the LACS solution and provide a governance structure for determining which solution changes should be implemented.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Build/Configure Resource Adapters and Service Interfaces.** Build/configure additional resource adapters and service interfaces to properly connect and manage authentication to new applications as they are integrated into the LACS infrastructure.


> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Modify Provisioning Workflows.** Update provisioning workflows as business needs and access rules change over time. Changes may also be required as resource owners experience the benefits that can be provided by LACS services and provisioning workflows can be streamlined.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Conduct Hardware/ Technology Refresh.** Conduct periodic updates and/or upgrades to solution hardware and other technology over the lifespan of a LACS solution as a means of extending the usable life of the solution or adding new capabilities.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Remove Sunsetted Resources.** Ultimately, IT resources are replaced, upgraded, or consolidated over time as mission and business needs change. Accordingly, as applications become sunsetted, user privileges will need to be de-provisioned and the resource itself can be disconnected from the LACS solution.
