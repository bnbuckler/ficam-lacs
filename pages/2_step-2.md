LACS projects offer agencies the potential to realize significant return on investment (ROI) in the form of cost avoidance, reallocation of resources, productivity gains, and reduced administrative burden. In order to achieve these benefits, your agency should assess its organizational structure, identity stores/repositories, access control processes, and IT resources when planning new or modifying existing LACS investments. 

In order to select an appropriate LACS solution that supports the agency mission and business goals, agencies should look beyond the up-front costs associated with LACS investments. There are additional factors that should be evaluated at an organizational and LACS project level when determining what type of LACS solution best meets the organization‘s needs. The table below provides examples of common factors and considerations that agencies should examine not only to determine implementation cost, but also determine the potential benefits that various LACS solutions are capable of providing.

<br>

| <center> Evaluation Factor </center> | <center> Description </center> |
|:--------------------------------------:|--------------------------------|
| **Organizational Size** | The number and type of users requiring access to agency IT resources, as well as the frequency of turnover of users, impacts the level of administrative effort required to provision user accounts and manage access privileges. |
| **Cost Effectiveness** | Your agency should evaluate the potential ROI compared with the upfront investment costs when planning for a LACS investment. |
| **Complexity of User Population** | Organizations with complex user and role management requirements should consider LACS solutions that offer services in these areas. User management complexity represents an opportunity to streamline existing processes or, potentially, an area that could significantly increase implementation costs.<br><br> Additionally, the availability (or lack thereof) of user repositories can impact implementation costs. |
| **Number of IT Resources** | The number of IT resources within an agency often dictates implementation time and can significantly affect implementation cost, depending on the resources’ connection requirements. |
| **Type of IT Resources** | The type of IT resources varies based on the platforms, operating systems, products, databases, etc. that are in use across the organization. These variances impact the complexity of integrating resources with the LACS infrastructure and require different integration processes. |
| **Complexity of Integrating with IT Resources** | Resource integration complexity is a combination of several factors, including: age of resource, underlying infrastructure, operating requirements, and user base. Combined, these factors among others indicate how complex it is to integrate particular resources into the LACS infrastructure. Large numbers of complex resources can increase overall implementation costs. At a high-level, the complexity and cost associated with common application types can be grouped as follows: <br><br> •	Web Based Applications – Low to Moderate Complexity <br> • Client/Server Applications – Moderate to High Complexity <br> • Distributed Applications – Varied Complexity <br>• Mainframe/Legacy Applications – High to Very High Complexity |
| **Business Goals/Drivers** | Organizational requirements for LACS solutions are driven by internal agency policies and business needs as well as required compliance with external federal policies and regulations. Certain solutions, while inexpensive, may not always create long term cost savings and may prohibit your agency from meeting certain business goals. |
| **Workflow Requirements** | Examine the complexity of various workflows that are used to provision user accounts and access privileges to IT resources. The number and complexity of your agency’s workflows impacts the schedule and labor costs associated with implementing some LACS solutions. |
| **Organizational IT Infrastructure** | Specific platforms and operating environments may require additional support and/or custom configuration to achieve the maximum benefit from LACS solutions. This also includes potential costs associated with networking LACS components, high-availability components, etc. Additionally, environments that use non-standard Operating Systems may require additional investment to integrate to a LACS infrastructure. |
| **Vendor Product Compatibility and Interoperability with Existing Infrastructure** | If your agency is considering using a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Identity Access Management (IAM) product suite for your LACS infrastructure, assess the integration approach of these products to ensure interoperability, and determine a best fit for your current infrastructures, applications, and business needs. Additionally, the availability of enterprise software licenses should be investigated, as these can significantly lower acquisition costs and influence your make or buy decision. |
| **Existing LACS Investments** | Your agency may already have existing investments in place that are capable of providing logical access services in a manner consistent with the FICAM architecture. These investments should be used wherever possible as they offer the potential to achieve a target LACS state without requiring significant investment from the organization. |
| **Bureau/Component Level Application Integration Needs** | Many agencies contain multiple bureaus/components that perform an array of mission-specific services. Often, these bureaus house IT resources that are used throughout the organization. Evaluate your agency's internal structure to determine how LACS services can be provided to bureau resources. This could be done at an enterprise level or de-centralized based upon agency-specific needs. |
| **Prioritized Logical Access Services** | When examining logical access needs, large efficiencies and ROI can be achieved by prioritizing deployment of certain access control services. This will be dependent on your agency’s infrastructure and existing LACS investments, but should be considered when determining how to implement LACS across the enterprise. |

<h3><span>Lesson Learned</span></h3>
<p><span>In order to drive adoption of its enterprise LACS and participation in pilot implementations, USDA offered to fund the initial LACS integration costs for a subset of agency applications that were candidates for early adoption. Doing so increased participation and enabled the Department to demonstrate technical using real world examples.</span></p>

Using the factors discussed in the table above along with others identified within the organization, your agency should complete a cost/benefit evaluation and develop a business plan to outline the selected LACS implementation approach, timeline, resource requirements, and estimated costs necessary to complete a LACS development effot.


## <span style="color: #0C5C89">**Checklist**</span>

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Evaluate alternatives.** Evaluate each potential solution and a variety of implementation approaches, which might include varying timelines, deployment scope, and deployment phasing.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Analyze technology solutions.** Analyze available COTS products, the ability to modify existing investments, and custom development options to determine which solution best suits the overall needs of your organization in the most cost effective manner.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Forecast cost and ROI.** Examine the total cost of solution ownership and maintenance for each potential alternative over a five year (at a minimum) period. This allows leadership to examine cost of ownership beyond the initial up-front investment cost, and accurately predict cost savings over a longer period of time.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Consider qualitative benefits.** Different implementation alternatives and approaches yield differing levels of qualitative benefits (process efficiencies, data privacy, information security, etc.) based on each agency‘s unique needs. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Assess the level of risk.** Each potential LACS alternative includes a certain level of risk, which could impact project cost, deployment schedule, organizational security, and user acceptance depending on the scope of LACS solutions. Evaluate all alternatives and plan to manage risk appropriately, regardless of the solution option selected.
