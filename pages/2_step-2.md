Planning for a LACS implementation is similar, in many respects, to planning for any other large-scale IT program. The far reaching scope of LACS solutions, however, increases the importance of planning activities to overall implementation success. 

## <span style="color: #0C5C89"><a name="plan"></a>**Checklist**</span>

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Begin Application Prioritization.** Examine your IT resources and develop application assessment criteria in order to prioritize and organize deployment of LACS services to agency IT resources.

> LACS solutions achieve their value primarily through integration with an agency‘s IT resources (applications). Once integrated, the applications use the LACS infrastructure to perform PIV-based PKI certificate authentication, and consume additional access control services (i.e., authorization, policy management, audit and reporting, etc.), if provided. Successfully integrating applications requires detailed planning as certain types of applications (e.g., legacy, custom built) are more complex to integrate and require additional time and resources. As a result, agencies should gather and assess information about their applications in an effort to categorize and prioritize them for integration. 
These factors should be evaluated to successfully prioritize an agency‘s applications for integration with the LACS infrastructure:

>> * **Risk Profile.** Risk profiles for applications consist of an evaluation of the application‘s compliance requirements, data sensitivity needs, data privacy requirements, and other artifacts of the FISMA and RMF processes. Low-impact applications should be used in early integration activities, such as a pilot implementation, to avoid disruptions to sensitive applications during deployment. Once the full enterprise LACS capability has been established, an agency will likely prioritize its highest impact applications for integration first.

>> * **Inclusion.** In order to achieve widely accepted value across the enterprise, you should integrate applications from a representative set of business and mission areas as soon as possible.

>> * **Technical Readiness.** Applications vary widely in their use of technology, platforms, operating systems, etc., and vary in maturity and usage. These factors, along with the complexity of the application‘s interfaces and availability of application connectors and service interfaces, contribute to the technical readiness of applications for integration. Agencies should seek to prioritize the applications that are the most technically ready as they are generally faster and easier to integrate.

>> * **Operational Readiness.** Many agencies operate applications that support mission-specific functions, which may dictate certain time periods where operational readiness is of the most concern. Agencies should seek to integrate applications during the most appropriate timeframe and take into consideration when the resource could tolerate integration efforts.

>> * **Application Life Cycle Phase.** An agency should prioritize integration of applications that are under development such that they can be linked to the enterprise LACS solution as they are deployed. Applications that are currently operational should be prioritized based on the other factors relevant to the application, such as technical readiness. An agency should identify any applications that are planned to be phased out, as these applications do not need to be integrated with the LACS solution.

> Each of the factors introduced above should be examined in greater detail against your agency‘s mission needs and operational business requirements in order to determine an appropriate weighting method for evaluating the agency‘s applications. Once the factors are weighted, each application should be evaluated and scored. This type of evaluation results in a score for each application, which can then be used to determine integration priority.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Develop Application Integration Guide.** Develop an Application Integration Guide, a formal document used to outline the process that an agency’s IT resources will go through to become integrated with the LACS solution.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Develop LACS Migration Plan.** Develop a migration plan that outlines how the agency plans to transition its logical resources to use the access control system.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Develop Pilot Implementation Plan.** Develop a plan and schedule for piloting the LACS solution on a small user population with well-defined resource requirements.
