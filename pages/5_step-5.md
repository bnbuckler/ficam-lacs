Pilot implementations are used to test newly developed solutions in a real-world environment on a small, well-defined group of users within a small number of easily integrated applications. This approach allows you to measure the effectiveness and user acceptance of the LACS solution in an environment that offers relatively low risk, while finely tuning the solution to ensure that it meets your agency's needs.

<h3><span>Privacy Tip</span></h3>
<p><span>While pilot implementations are often small in size and scope, keep in mind that legal and regulatory requirements for privacy and data protection apply equally to pilot implementations. Involve appropriate personnel from privacy and security offices to ensure that adequate safeguards are in place prior to implementing pilot activities.</span></p>

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Define the scope of the pilot.** Start with a limited number of willing and informed users, using agency PIV cards to access the agency‘s domain. Given the potential risk of delays or inability for users to log on to their computers, consider excluding personnel who require IT access with minimal disruption. Use cases that fall within the scope of the pilot should also be developed and use cases that can be addressed based on the success of the initial pilot should be identified.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Identify the potential privacy impacts of pilot.** Evaluate the type of data that is being used and/or exchanged within the pilot to determine if live production data containing any PII will be included. Consider using alternative data sources, if available, or ensure that the live production data is properly protected and disposed of in accordance with your agency‘s privacy and data protection policies.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Identify metrics for success and determine how evaluation data will be collected.** Evaluate the performance of the LACS solution in terms of the number of authentication attempts (successful and unsuccessful), application downtime as a result of solution usage, and measure the acceptance and use of the solution by the pilot participants.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Ensure coordination and communication takes place.** Pilot implementations require coordination between LACS program management, resource owners and administrators, and program stakeholders. The pilot project manager should be responsible for managing the overall schedule and ensuring that updates, concerns, and lessons learned are communicated to the pilot participants in a timely manner.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Identify pilot participants.** Involve participants who will provide a broad representation of users‘ familiarity with using smart cards, office, position, physical location, and hardware used. Additionally, consider the users‘ willingness to accept the risk associated with use of the new technology and who may be easily helped if they experience problems.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Formally evaluate the success of the pilot implementation.** Hold a formal evaluation of the criteria for success immediately following the program‘s conclusion. This allows you to identify and correct any deficiencies with the LACS solution before wide-scale deployment occurs.
