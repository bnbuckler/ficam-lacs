# LACS Development
----------------------------------------------------------------

### What is the LACS Development Playbook?

A Logical Access Control System (LACS) is an automated system that controls a user‘s ability to access one or more computer system resources such as a workstation, network, application, or database. A LACS validates a user’s identity through some mechanism such as a PIN, card, biometric, or other token. Based on the selected implementation path, it also grants or denies user access to resources based on pre-defined criteria, such as affiliation with the organization, role, or individual privileges granted to further the agency‘s mission. A LACS solution, includes the following characteristics:

> * Provides high assurance of user identity while allowing streamlined access across multiple applications using a single credential;

> * Reduces administrative burden on the part of resource owners and administrators by minimizing the need to manually manage user accounts and access privileges;

> * Enables streamlined detection and remediation of conflicting access privileges within and across resources (e.g., segregation of duties);

> * Provides a standardized, strong authentication mechanism for users accessing agency resources;

> * Secures access through strong authentication for remote users accessing agency resources;

> * Supports the use of encryption and digital signature services to encrypt and digitally sign data using the PIV card; and

> * Enables strong authentication for remote users while leveraging the existing infrastructure.
	

This playbook supports achievement of implementing a LACS at your organization. It primarily addresses solution architecture and components that enable PIV authentication PIV card, however, other authentication types (e.g., PIV biometric authentication) may be supported within your agency.


### How is the playbook structured?

We developed this playbook into 4 individual steps, or activities. Within each step, you will find a checklist to help you perform that activity and additional guidance, like frequently asked questions (FAQs), implementation tips, or security and privacy considerations.


### How was the playbook developed?

This playbook was created using updated and migrated content that previously was found in the FICAM Roadmap and Implementation Guidance v2.0. We hope that the new format encourages you and your agency to contribute to additional content to support the access control management across the Federal government.


### Where can I find additional content?

The FICAM Architecture provides a high-level overview of identity management and a description of the services that deliver identity management capabilities. We recommend that you visit the <a href="http://gsa.github.io/ficam-arch/" target="_blank"> FICAM Architecture</a> site to gain a basic understanding of identity management and how its role in broader federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM). The ‘Manage Access Control’ Playbook provides detailed steps and activities, as well as conceptual descriptions of access control models and lifecycles, that an agency should consider before implementation.


### How can I contribute to this playbook?

We look forward to your use and contribution to this playbook. Please visit our  <a href="http://bnbuckler.github.io/ficam-identity/contribute/" target =" _blank"> Contribute page </a> to learn how to post questions and contribute content.
